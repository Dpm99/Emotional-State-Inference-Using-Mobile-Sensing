# Investigation-smartphone-sensing-features-for-emotional-state-inference
As the project for my MSc thesis I investigated the rich dataset called StudentLife, an experiment comprised of 60 students from the Dartmouth college.

Due to the heterogeneous characteristics of depression, diagnosis is often hard to perform and the time interval between first showing depression symptoms and the first treatment can be as big as 8 years. Given the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, it is not surprising that our emotions have a direct impact with our interactions with them, furthermore with the continuous smartphone advancements, scientist have been able to collect important mobile sensing data that has already shown to link back to depression and it's symptom severity. Therefore, the question arises: Can mobile sensing data be used to infer and predict daily aspects interconnected with depression to help it's diagnosis? To answer this question we investigate the data produced from StudentLife, a study that monitored the mental state of a collection of students of Dartmouth University for a period of 10 weeks. We show that mobile sensing data provides reliable enough features to accurately predict stress signs, sleep quality and depression signs.
